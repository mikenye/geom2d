// BoundingBox calculates the axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) of the circle.

// The bounding box is the smallest rectangle, aligned with the coordinate axes, that completely encloses the circle.

//
// Returns:
//   - [Rectangle][T]: The axis-aligned bounding box that encloses the circle.
//
// Notes:
//   - The bounding box is a rectangle defined by the four corner points derived from the circle's center and radius.

// RelationshipToCircle determines the spatial relationship between two circles.
//
// This function evaluates the relationship between the current circle and another
// circle by comparing their center points and radii. The possible relationships include:
//   - [RelationshipEqual]: The circles are identical.
//   - [RelationshipContainedBy]: The current circle is completely contained within the other circle.
//   - [RelationshipContains]: The current circle completely contains the other circle.
//   - [RelationshipIntersection]: The circles overlap, including tangency.
//   - [RelationshipDisjoint]: The circles do not overlap.
//
// Parameters:
//   - other (Circle[T]): The circle to compare against the current circle.
//   - opts: A variadic slice of [Option] functions to customize the equality check.
//     [WithEpsilon](epsilon float64): Specifies a tolerance for comparing the center coordinates
//     and radii of the circles, allowing for robust handling of floating-point precision errors.
//
// Returns:
//   - [Relationship]: A constant representing the relationship between the circles.
//
// Behavior:
//   - The function first checks for equality by comparing center points and radii.
//   - It then checks for containment by comparing the distance between centers and radii.
//   - Intersection is detected if the distance between centers is less than or equal to the sum of the radii.
//   - If no other relationship is found, the circles are considered disjoint.

//   - l ([LineSegment][T]): The line segment to compare against the circle.
//   - opts: A variadic slice of [Option] functions to customize the equality check.

// RelationshipToPolyTree determines the spatial relationships between the Circle and the polygons in the given [PolyTree].
//
// This method evaluates whether the circle intersects, contains, or is contained by each polygon in the [PolyTree].
// It uses a doubled representation of the Circle to align with the doubled points in the [PolyTree] for robust computations.
//
// Parameters:
//   - pt (*[PolyTree][T]): The [PolyTree] whose polygons will be compared to the Circle.
//   - opts: A variadic slice of [Option] functions to customize the equality check.
//     [WithEpsilon](epsilon float64): Specifies a tolerance for comparing the center coordinates
//     and radii of the circles, allowing for robust handling of floating-point precision errors.
//
// Behavior:
//   - For each polygon in the [PolyTree], the function iterates through its edges and checks the relationship to the Circle.
//   - Intersection is checked first; if any edge of the polygon intersects the circle, the relationship is marked as [RelationshipIntersection].
//   - If all edges of the polygon lie within the circle's radius, the relationship is marked as [RelationshipContains].
//   - If the circle's center lies within the polygon and its minimum distance to any edge is greater than its radius, the relationship is marked as [RelationshipContainedBy].
//   - If none of the above conditions are satisfied, the relationship is marked as [RelationshipDisjoint].
//
// Returns:
//   - map[*[PolyTree][T]][Relationship]: A map where each key is a pointer to a polygon in the [PolyTree], and the value is the relationship between the Circle and that polygon.

// RelationshipToRectangle determines the spatial relationship between the circle and the rectangle.

//   - Fully contains the rectangle (encloses it entirely),

//
// Parameters:

//   - opts: A variadic slice of [Option] functions to customize the behavior of the relationship check.
//     [WithEpsilon](epsilon float64): Specifies a tolerance for floating-point precision.
//
// Behavior:
//   - The function checks each edge of the rectangle for potential intersections with the circle.
//   - If all edges of the rectangle are fully contained within the circle, it returns [RelationshipContains].
//   - If the rectangle fully contains the circle (the circleâ€™s center is inside the rectangle, and the circle
//     does not extend beyond any edge), it returns [RelationshipContainedBy].
//   - If none of these conditions are met, it determines whether the circle and rectangle are disjoint.
//
// Returns:
//
// [Relationship]: One of the following constants:
//   - [RelationshipDisjoint]: The circle and rectangle are entirely separate.
//   - [RelationshipIntersection]: The circle intersects with one or more edges of the rectangle.
//   - [RelationshipContains]: The circle completely encloses the rectangle.
